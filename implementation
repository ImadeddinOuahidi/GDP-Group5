1.Frontend → Backend Integration

Connect text/voice/photo components to the API you just built.

Ensure reports are actually submitted and saved in DB.

Commit: feat: integrate frontend reporting components with backend API

2. Severity Feedback UI

After a report is submitted, show the AI severity classification (Mild / Moderate / Severe).

Helps us know their submission was processed.

Commit: feat: display AI severity feedback after report submission

Report History / Dashboard

Let us see their past submissions (text, photo, voice) with severity labels.

Backend: add /reports GET endpoint (filter by user).

Frontend: build a simple list UI to display report type, date, and severity color badge.

Commit: feat: add report history screen showing previous submissions

2. User Authentication in Frontend

We have auth backend — now wire it into the frontend.

Add signup/login screens.

Store JWT token in AsyncStorage and attach to all API calls.

Commit: feat: implement login/signup UI with JWT-based authentication

1. User-Specific Report History

Now that users can log in, show only their submitted reports.

Backend: update /reports GET to filter by userId from JWT.

Frontend: fetch and display reports in a simple list view.

Commit: feat: implement user-specific report history screen

🟢 Why this is good: Makes login meaningful; gives users visibility of what they’ve submitted.

2. Logout & Auth Session Handling

Add logout button to clear token from AsyncStorage.

Auto-redirect to login if token is missing or expired.

Commit: feat: add logout functionality and session management

🟢 Why this is good: Completes the authentication cycle and prevents unauthorized access.

3. Voice & Photo Upload Integration

Connect your existing voice/photo components to backend now that users are authenticated.

Include Authorization header with uploads.

Commit: feat: enable voice and photo report submission with authentication

🟢 Why this is good: Expands functionality beyond text now that identity is secured.
